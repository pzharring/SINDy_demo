Playing around with SINDy sparse regression
Peter Harrington

Testing out the SINDy (Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics) technique to discover governing equations of a dynamical system, 
proposed by Brunton, Proctor, & Kutz (2016). Uses the total variation regularization (TVR) differentiation from Chartrand (2011).

Tests include the Lorenz, Chen, and Rossler chaotic attractor systems, along with two Hopf bifurcations.
